# 🎯 Objectives

Normalize data from a flat dataset into 3NF.

Load the normalized tables into a PostgreSQL database.

Use SQL queries to analyze key business metrics.

Identify top-performing products, customers, and regions.

Present findings in a simple data report or dashboard.

# 🗂 Database Design

The database was designed with normalization in mind to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and integrity of data.
